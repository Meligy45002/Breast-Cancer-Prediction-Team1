This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using data preprocessing, feature analysis, and machine learning models.
It is based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains various features computed from digitized images of breast masses.
